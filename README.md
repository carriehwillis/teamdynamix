> Rogue, not-officially-sanctioned scripts I've built to do things for TeamDynamix customers.

## Overview ##
I *do* work at TeamDynamix, but I'm not a developer. I work with the Professional Services team and sometimes have to do some API calls for customers. I've written some Python scripts to make these API calls easier.

**Note** though: I'm **not a developer**, and these aren't officially-sanctioned scripts.

The officially-sanctioned scripts are located at <a href="https://www.github.com/TeamDynamix" target="_blank" title="TeamDynamix GitHub Repository">github.com/TeamDynamix</a> and are PowerShell, not Python, scripts.

## Feedback ##
There are probably ways to streamline/improve the scripts here, and I'm working on that periodically. If you have any feedback on any of the scripts provided here, please let me know!
